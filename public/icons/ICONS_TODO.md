# PWA Icons TODO

The manifest requires PNG icons.

## Quick Fix:
1. Use online tool: https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Upload `icon.svg`
3. Set width to 192px → Download as `icon-192.png`
4. Set width to 512px → Download as `icon-512.png`
5. Place both in this directory

## Alternative:
Use any design tool (Figma, Photoshop, etc.) to export the SVG as PNG at the required sizes.

The icon is a blue circle with a white sparkle - simple and recognizable!
